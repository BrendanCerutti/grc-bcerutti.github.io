            <h4> After working in a bagel shop since he was 15. Brendan decided to open his own bagel shop in San Luis Obispo. He knew that there were not many great options for bagels in the area and wanted to capitalize on the market. The name of the shop comes after a nickname he got working at his old local bagel shop. The nickname stuck and Brando's Bagels was created.</h4>
