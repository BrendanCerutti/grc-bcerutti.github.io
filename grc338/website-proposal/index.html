         <h2>Target audience</h2>
         <p>My target audience is men of all ages! Preferably 10 and above. We love to younger guys but our shop is more tailored to the men older than 20.</p>
         <p>The primary goal is to give the best haircuts we can possibly give to our customers. We want to help men feel more confident with the way they look. After quarantine when they start to go on dates, they are going to need a good haricut!</p>

            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Our barber shop was created after the 2020 corona virus. During the quarantine, our barbers working together to learn and master their skills of cutting hair. They used the time to profect their skills and build their client base. After the quarantine they opened the Clean Cuts shop and the rest was history.</p>
